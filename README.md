So far this notebook identifies stunts and uses given data to to not only see tendencies of when stunts are most likley to occur but also what situations they are most effective in.

The notebook is set up to run as if you were a coach looking to scout this week's team so there is a variable at the top of the notebook to pick whichever team you'd like to see stunt summaries for.
